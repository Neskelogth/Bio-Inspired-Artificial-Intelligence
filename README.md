Simplifying assumptions:
    Multiple worker ants can spawn in the same map point
    Multiple ants can be in the same spot at the same time
    The resources can be indefinitely stacked at the spawn point
    The queen ant does not move from the spawn point
    The worker Ants can communicate with the queen ant when they are on the spawn point, regardless of the distance with the queen
    Ants can move through the ground
    Worker ants can pick only the resources. After the resource is picked, the voxel becomes a ``ground'' voxel
